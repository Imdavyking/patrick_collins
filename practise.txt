Nigeria is experiencing a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is a component of the global SAR COV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) pandemic (Marra MA et al.,Butterfield Y, et al). Certain animal species, including cattle, camels, and bats, frequently carry coronaviruses that can infect humans. According to several medical professionals, the new coronavirus strain probably originated in bats or pangolins (Anthony SJ et al, 2017). China's Wuhan was the site of the first human transmission (Hui DS, et al, 2020,Chin TD et al, 2020). Since then, person-to-person contact has been the primary method of viral transmission. Close contact with an infected individual is the most typical method of virus transmission. When COVID-19 patients cough or exhale, They discharge microscopic droplets containing the virus. These droplets might get into a person's mouth or nose who doesn't have the virus, which would transmit the infection (Parry J, 2020). Although a person's symptoms are at their worst when the sickness is most contagious, it is still feasible for someone who is symptom-free to transfer the virus (Landry MD et al, 2020). The virus can spread when droplets carrying it land on surrounding items or surfaces that other individuals subsequently touch, pick up, or use their mouths, noses, or eyes to contact (Parry J, 2020,Landry MD et al, 2020).
The Federal Ministry of Health in Nigeria announced the first COVID-19 case on February 27, 2020.
An Italian national employed in Nigeria traveled back to Lagos, Nigeria, on February 25, 2020, from Milan, Italy (Maclean R, 2020, Dahir AL, 2020). Since that time, both in Nigeria and throughout the world, there have been an increasing number of confirmed cases of illness. 13 nations—the United States, United Kingdom, South Korea, Switzerland, Germany, France, Italy, China, Spain, Netherlands, Norway, Japan, and Iran—have been placed under a travel restriction by Nigeria due to high viral prevalence. The World Health Organization (WHO) designates COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. A pandemic is a disease that has spread over a significant area, such as several continents or the entire planet (Cucinotta D, Vanelli M. 2020).
Humanity has battled a number of global health calamities that have threatened to eradicate humans off the face of the globe over the years. It is important to understand that the coronavirus differs from the plagues and diseases that have afflicted humanity throughout history in that none have had such a significant impact on global education as COVID19 (UNESCO 2020). The black death (1346–1553), which spread from Asia to Europe and left a path of destruction in its wake, is just one of many plagues.
However, despite the pandemic's prevalent name, scientists are not exactly certain where the virus began. They do, however, know that it was caused by an H1N1 virus (similar to swine flu) that originated in birds. The Spanish flu (1918–1920) is also among the worst pandemics in history (Sahu P, 2020). Another major epidemic that originated in China was the Asian flu (1957–1958), which claimed more than 1 million deaths globally. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the illness spread quickly and was discovered in Singapore in February 1957, Hong Kong in April 1957, and coastal American towns in the summer of 1957. (Chin TD et al, 2020).
With nearly 28,600 documented cases and 11,325 fatalities, the West African Ebola pandemic (2013–2016) wreaked havoc on the countries of West Africa. The disease was initially discovered in Guinea in December 2013, and it quickly spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone after that (Broadhurst MJ, 2016, Brooks TJ, 2016 Pollock NR ,2016). However, the aforementioned pandemics and plagues have ravaged the world, disrupting educational processes in a variety of ways. In some cases, this results in school closures, which has serious negative effects for students and robs them of their right to an education. It also exposes them to future risk (UNESCO, Inc R, 2020).
The Federal Ministry of Education, through the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, ordered the immediate closure of tertiary institutions, secondary schools, and primary schools across the nation on March 19th due to the outbreak of the disease in the nation. This was done as part of measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Additionally, interstate travel was restricted, markets were locked, religious gatherings of more than 10 people were prohibited, and social events like parties, ceremonies, club meetings, etc. were suspended (Parke C, 2020, Burke D, 2020). As per the government's order, all public and private schools must close their doors. Substantial disparities in the education system have been exposed by the pandemic. 
While some private schools in urban areas are utilizing online instruction to engage their pupils, many students who are less fortunate or live in rural regions were excluded (UNESCO, 2020). Lack of facilities prevents most schools from successfully using online instruction, unlike those in industrialized nations (UNESCO, 2020). The purpose of this opinion piece is to investigate the effects of school closures caused by COVID-19 on Nigeria's educational system. This essay also addresses the benefits and drawbacks of online and virtual learning, which in Nigeria has taken the place of face-to-face instruction.
